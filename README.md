## Install
Use your favorite zsh plugin manager as usual.

For example, using zinit:
```
zinit light tactlessfish/ribbon-prompt
```

## Notes
- Only looks good when the colorscheme's black is the same as its background color.
- No bells & whistles, just the current directory.
- Requires Powerline symbols
