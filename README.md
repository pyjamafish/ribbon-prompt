## Install
Use your favorite zsh plugin manager as usual.

For example, using zinit:
```
zinit light tactlessfish/ribbon-prompt
```

## Notes
- No bells & whistles: just shows the current directory (and virtual environment, if in one)
- Requires Powerline "left arrow" glypth.
- Looks wonky in terminals with transparency.
